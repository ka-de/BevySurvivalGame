# Inventory TODO

<!-- - Add hotbar -->
<!-- - Bug: can lose an item if you pick up 2 very fast? -->

- Update assets
  <!-- - hotbar fades/greys when inventory is open, or add a faint overlay -->
  <!-- - Allow dragging out of inv to drop (use timer comp) -->
  - Bug: updating while draging item stack doesnt update text.
- Add double click to colelct all items of same type to a stack

# Components for UI

- `InventorySlotWidget`
  - Has state for what item metadata it holds, or a ref to its slot number that looks up a map for the data
  - On hover events, displays `TooltipWidget` with metadata, and makes the slot change color
  - Image can be different for Hotbar slots
- `InventoryWidget`
  - a grid of `InventorySlotWidgets`
  - opens on a keypress
- `ProgressBarWidget`
  - holds state for percentage, renders inner rectangle's size as percentage of full size
- `TooltipWidget`
  - rectangle (transparent?) with text and image (?) of metadata of item

# Implementation Notes for drag/hover system:

## Defs

- `Interactable:` Component, {state: Interaction, previous state} defines entity that can be interacted with this system
- `Interaction:` Enum, defines states None, hover, Drag
- `DropEvent:` Event, {held en, drop en, pos}

## System Fns

- a system that does a cursor raycast to the window and checks for any entity hits with `Interactable`. When raycast returns a hit, set its state to hover. If there was a click mouse event that frame, then set it to dragging, send click event.
- a system that clears all drags (resets `Interaction::None`), runs before above.
- Drag system that checks for any `Interactable`s that have state == dragging, sets their transform to the cursor transform
- system to track dragging changes, if dragging stopped, send `DropEvent`
- System that listens for `DropEvents` and swaps the dropped entities positions in the grid

# UI System

- Spawn `SpriteSheetBundles` with custom Component `Interactable` `UIElement`, and `InventorySlot`, etc.

  - Inventory spawned with slot entities as childern. Slots get position based on their slot index, which is iter from inventory.
  -

- `Interactable` entities are subject to Drag Plugin, which handles dragging/hover states,
- Input Plugin listens for mouse events while inventory is open.

  - Use aabb collider system to check if mouse is inside each `UI` entity.
  - Send `MouseIn`, `MouseOut` events when cursor enters/exits. These trigger `Hover`
  - Send `MouseDown`, `MouseUp` events which trigger click/drag states
  - Events send the entitiy that triggered them as part of data

  # Inventory System V2

  ## goals

  - Clicking on item picks it up and locks it to cursor. Left = whole stack, Right = half
  - Clicking again while dragging attempts to drop the stack in a slot
  - If the dropped slot has a stack, it gets added to the cursor next.

  ## technical notes

  - when interacting with UI, actions physically move inventory item stacks to your cursor.
  - allows for precise manipulation of the inventory state and ui.
  - less room for errors in syncing between "fake" pick up of stacks
  - Clicking 1st time removes IIS to cursor (attach a drag comp?)
  - Clicking 2nd time checks if any IIS have the drag component, and if they do, performs a drop
  - Dropping action looks at the hittest slot and checks if its empty. If its not, sets the current slots ISS to drag comp
  - While dragging, right clicking drops one item at a time (create new entity with count 1, and call drop.
    Fail if the target slot is not empty or the same type).
  - Right clicks work the same, but only half the slot is added to the cursor (create new entity with half the count)
  - If same slot, merge. If dropped outside of inv, spawn an ItemStack

  ## Tooltips

  - Items in `ItemStacks` can have `ItemMetaData` Component, which will holds things like:
    - Desc: Item lore/description
    - Vec of Attributes (need to_string impl): Stats like att, dur, etc
  - Tooltips will display the data
  - Items by default will have a default impl of `ItemMetaData`, or a randomly generated one by a drop system
  - Different gameplay systems can modify `Attributes` which will update `ItemMetaData` in a `Changed<>` query system thing

  ## Next Features:

  //TODO: add ron file for stats/metadata for WorldObjects
  [x] Impl `LootTable` for drops list on enemies and breakable items

  [x] Impl spawners that auto spawn mobs

proto todo:

- make impl for mesh2dmaterial that takes input of asset, size, move txfm to .insert()
- add item attribute systemparam?

how to set up item prefabs:

- Equipment that enter the world as an Entity from a drop:
  - use prefab custom impl that takes attribute min/max, calculates an rng roll per stat
- spawn_item_drop already takes optional attributes override. use this for existing items that get dropped from inv
- creating an item directly into the inventory will currently not work with this design. if its not an entity, cant use prefab to get attributes

BUG: moving very far causes dash cooldown to double in speed? weird behaviour
BUG: move dash tick to animations.rs, also dash movement is mega glitched rn

TODO: `AttackState` remove attack related data to components, for proto? basically how do we
TODO: remove fireball from world object/sprite sheet, make own file, with animation
impl different att styles w seldum_state

## Misc. Design Ideas

- item identification
- item re-rolling
- mobs drop keys to bosses
  - progression dependant on level/area?
  - biomes spawn based on distance?
- small towns spawn
  - chance to have npcs that do actions for you, or sell gear?
    - item identifier
    - blacksmith - sells gear
    - dark auction house style dude
- rework inventory uis to use states
  - different states to easily change what UIs ar shown for npc trades, etc
- ui slot for off-hands (throwable or any right-clickable item)
- rework tooltips to be a large display on the side?
- possible UI refactor is include InventorySlotState in InventoryItemStack

## Projectile/Magic ideas

- orb that spins around you as you walk, attack fires the orb, then respawns or comes back

## Foliage/object rework notes:

- convert tile object hash to a vec of 4 objects, 1 for each quadrant
  - objects like trees or walls take up all 4, grass/flowers/chests take up 1
- Add world generation for grass/flower clusters

## Gameloop ideas:

- Player starts weak in a tough environment. Hostile and Neutral Mobs need to be avoided for now.
- Early game revolves around getting grass/trees/rocks for early materials (sticks, plant fibre -> string, stone shards)
  - `Goal:` build first tools/weapons
- Kill animals for food/wool/leather `Goal:` get beginner armor, food
- From here options are open: Explore world, Try to kill mobs, Dungeon farming/mining
  - `Goal:` get progressivly stronger gear
- Find boss summon keys, various methods (mob drop, crafting, dungeon loot)
  - `Goal:` kill all bosses
- World changes in difficulty after each boss is defeataed. New Mobs/harder mobs, new dungeons/harder dungeons
  TODO: Maybe there is a way to tick all timers in one system rather than each handle their own timers?
  TODO: upgrade collider animation proto to use more detail: each frame can take a [shape, size, rotation, position]

## Mob Ideas

- Neutral Slime: basic early game slime mob, basic charge attack/follow
- Goblin archers: basic early game aggro, keep at distance and fire arrows
- Goblin Fighters(?): aggro, spawn in hordes, sometimes with archers, are faster, fight by slashing a sword when in range
- Mushroom: basic early game aggro mob, hops towards player, attacks with poison smoke thing (make this into a type of action, use proto for specifications to size of attack and asset), leaves poison cloud when dead that damages?

## Attribute Ideas

- All weapons have Attack (maybe called DMG?): 10 Attack or 11-24 Attack
- All weapons have Hit Speed (maybe called DMG?): 1.5 Hits/s, etc
- All armor have Health: +10 Health (or HP)
- Unbreaking (durability)
- Crit chance: +3% Crit
- Crit DMG: +10% Crit DMG
- Bonus Damage: +10 DMG
- Health Regen: +10 HP Regen or HP/s

- Thorns: +10% Thorns
- Dodge: +10% Dodge
- Speed: +10% Speed
- Lifesteal: +1 Lifesteal
- Defense: +10 Defense
- Loot Rate: +10% Loot
- Venom
- Burn
- Mana
- Mana Leech

- Experience Rate: +10% XP

## Biomes + Mobs + Themes

- [x] Grass Plains biome (Slimes, Slugs, Boar, Pigs, Bees/Bugs), gather pebbles on ground
  - rare healing flower
- [x] Forest, (Slugs, Mushroom, Goblins, Bugs,), gather pebbles on ground
  - rare healing flower
- [xx] Desert, a little more dangerous, but has dead branch that gives sticks early on
  - rare burried treasure, digs up random item from loottable

## Progression Notes

# Mats/Drops/Gear Aquisition

- Limited weapon types: 6-8 (2-3 meleee, 2 ranged, 3 magic)
  <!-- - Weapons drop at random from mobs, some have higher rates to drop specific ones -->
  <!-- - armor/trinkets/accessories drop at random as well from mobs -->
- some armor can be crafted from materials or mob drops
<!-- - weapons can be crafted from mat/drops too, -->
- Dungeons will have ores, overworld other mats like leather/wood
- Wooden sword will be everyones starter weapon, mats to craft found in overworld
  - maybe rebrand this to a `sturdy stick`
- out-of-run progression could be you get to pick a new starter weapon
- generic armor can be crafted fairly early on (leather, chain)
  - leather from animals, chain from metal fragments from boulders?
  <!-- - how can weapons be crafted?
  - swords/daggers/bows are easy, what about magic weapons? -->
  <!-- - magic runes or w/e drop from mobs rarely, each maps to one elemental magic weapon -->
- loot drops as unidentified weapons -> need to be identified in a block with money?

# What Will Be Crafting

- Bandages
- Utility Blocks: Chest, anvils, upgrading stone, Identification stone
- Tools,
- Building: Walls, doors, presure plate, bed, walking planks, boats,
- Utility blocks: WarpStone
- plant/farming/food related things
- towns can have quests for items -> get money
- perhapse armor can be crafted in unique block
- fishing?

# Upgrades

- weapons/armor can be upgraded with scrolls to boost base dmg
  - scrolls are rare drops from mobs/chests/merchants/bosses
- Orbs of alteration - can reconfigure bonus stats on anything
  - also rare drop
- Maybe both of these can be applied at an anvil-like item
  - 2 slots, first for scrolls/orbs, second for the item
  - same UI can be used for repairs maybe

# Level Progression

- Mobs give exp. Leveling increasingly harder as mob exp will generally not increase.
- After every boss, world gets harder and mob exp increases
- Encourages player to fight bosses eventually as grinding levels increasingly less rewarding
- Each Level grants an opportunity to increase stats
  - STR: dmg, armor, DEX: crit, crit dmg, AGI: speed, dodge, VIT: hp, hp/s
- Leveling makes player decently stronger. All stats are applicable to all weapons, but some might benefit from certain stats more

# Trinkets

- Give larger buffs, boss drops, dungeon loot, very rare mob drops (elites)
- things like: bonus leech, crit, dmg, DoT stuff, dash modifiers, etc

# World Difficulty Progression

- clearing a boss makes the world harder
- mobs have more hp, speed, dmg, maybe new mechanics
- maybe new mobs can be found
- higher chance for elites

# World Generation Progression

- start in plains/dessert/beach areas
- forrest is next, maybe swamp,
- snow/lava?
- dungeons change theme too based on the biome theyre from?

# Recipes and Drops

- Rocks: flint, rock shard, coal*, metal*?
  - Walls, arrows,
- Coal: Coal
  - smelt things, lighting later
- Metal: rock, metal
  - armor, throwing stars, etc

Melee weapons == starter weapons/unlimited resource weapons
bow/claw are op bc of range, but need resources (Arrow/stars)
magic needs mana??

mob drops = make potions? (mana/hp) -> this is the mats to get magic resources

Night cycle?? night time mobs become hostile or start to spawn more hostile ones?
some type of daily market event => most reliable way to get scrolls + orbs, rare item drop?

Interactable chests spawn mobs to kill which give loot
Dungeons are smaller, with an unbreakable wall barrier around them, might reduce lag

- should they have a timer?

- Stick
- Wood Wall
- Bandage
- Stone Wall
- Chest,
- String

##

[x] add velocity to dmg numbers, and fade out
add acceleration to player
cape + clothes
[] fix desc of all items
[x] bunch of recipes are missing, of course
[] tweak rarity of upgrade tome/orbs

[x] fix upgrade tome for equipment
[x] add esc to close container
[x] check if player spawn thing works

use tile coordinate multiplied by big number and module down to check if obj spawns. deterministic spawning.
use air blocks to determin a broken tile, regen world
make objects be defined by a 2x2 grid rather than 1x1 or 2x2 allow 2x1 and 1x2
add mobs to world gen params?
[x] make dungeon spawn with mobs initially, and hostile
particles w gradient, or tweak idk
dungeon chest has chance to spawn mobs
big brain: move the grid down until its at 0,0, not move the player
sapplings!!!
add juice explosion to projectiles on hit
can shift click crafting items to inv...
forrest armor too strong...

<!-- reloading chunk needs to remove water colliders from bridge -->
<!-- Player placed chests re-spawn as loot chests... -->

arrows double-hit
arrows can dmg objects
cant shoot proj over water
pick up item existign in inv when its full doesnt work
make mobs get stronger slightly every day.
MAGIC LIGHTING 2D
SOUNDS!

<!-- FRAME START -> (gen objs (prev frame), send chunk event -> spawn chunk, spawn dim event)  -> {CF} -> update walls -->

quick impls to feel out

- make dash faster
- animation startup for sword feels weird?
- should items have a level that scales with stats?

  - solves issue of getting random rng good drops in the early game and being op + items not scaling well at all + everything was the same power
  - also solves the fact that i only have a few item variations, this way items dont have to have to be balanced in different "power levels" (armor for example)
  - means that player will want to continue to upgrade their gear, via new drops, or upgrades
  - upgrade tome will just upgrade the level, which will guide the stat increase too.
    BUG: miss-matched items unstackable (add log)
    BUG: Slime proj dont hit, get destroyed by other colliders
  - mana regen and mana steal
  - lower drop rate of arrows and starss

  muck progression notes:

- progression is done through 2 things: chests/relics and higher tiers of gear
  - chests are gained through gold: incentivises killing mobs, and also exploring for free chests
  - higher tiers of gear gained through mining/trees: incentivises foraging/exploring
- gold is the true progression, since mobs give gold rather than gear/upgrades.
- all gear is crafted
- urgency comes from: mobs get stronger every night, very quickly, gotta explore to find chests/higher tiers of materials
- only get strong from 2 sources: relics and gear

notes for game:

- mobs get stronger quickly, higher health + dmg
- level up to add stat points -> agency to pick direction for build
- need lvl req to wear equipment
- equipment gets stronger as days progress (higher lvl mobs drop higher lvl equipment)
- 2 sources of progression: stat points, gear
- both gear and stat points incentivise killing mobs
- shelter, food, resources, and upgrading gear incentivise exploration/material gathering
- exploration incentivised to find dungeons
  - dungeon enemies match strenght of enemeis by day count

island variation:

- world generation is no longer infinite open world
- spawn on a randomly generated island, surrounded by water
- later, could introduce sections that are blocked off by unbreakable trees (can signify tiers of gear)
  - progress to harder area by getting strongest tools in previous area
- 1 dungeon spawner per area (or full island if no areas)
- every new day, the dungeon its different, repopulated with loot and mobs, maybe you can only enter once per day too
- on certain days, it could be a boss arena too
- would imply limited resources, 2 ways to solve this
  - add farming/plant growth: a way to regenerate plants/mushrooms
  - stone/ores can be later farmed in dungeons once they run out in the overworld

# Main Menu

Buttons:

- Play: opens window to pick a save (3 slots). default empty icon, then a designed one with some data on the run (night, level)
- Settings: opens settings menu -> one system to handle all options, match on enum, buttons just call an event with that enum type
